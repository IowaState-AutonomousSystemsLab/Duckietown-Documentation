# Duckietown-Documentation

## Installing all requirements

* use ./duckietown_installation to install all required dts libraries
* chnages after source ~/.bashrc only refelct while opening a new termonal, so close the installation terminal and open a new terminal
* now run the post_installation script to set chnages and final installation of duckietown.
* now use dts commands to see how dts works.
* **NOTE: Do 'chmod +x duckietown_installation' before running the script (./duckietown_installation)**

* For ros_installation, run the script once, after its done executing, type 'bash' to open a new instance of the shell and run the script once more. This will source ros in bashrc. After this type, 'rosdep update' to finish setting up ROS.
